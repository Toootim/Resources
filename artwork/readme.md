# Mascot for Tooot.im

We're a small community but we want to grow and so we need a mascot.
At the moment we are using one done [by Zeev](https://tooot.im/@zeiiv), but it includes a non-free
element (the strawberry) and the resolution is a bit low for prints.

Along came [@EshGalili](https://tooot.im/@EshGalili) and started playing with a concept of his own:

And after several more iterations he [invited peeps to vote](https://tooot.im/@EshGalili/262891)

Finally an offer by Ira, based on a public domain (CC0) strawberry on a low-resulution
lephantoid from the project's original artwork.
